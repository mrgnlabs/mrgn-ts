# A User Guide to Liquid Staking with marginfi

To stake your SOL on Solana means to delegate your SOL tokens to a validator, allowing them to participate in the network’s consensus process, while earning staking rewards. Solana’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism dictates that validators with a higher amount of staked SOL are more likely to be selected as <Button href="https://mirror.xyz/madhavg.eth/yIKQdvOnTmq5LhDUQam-XWUrDGWYv8MTigAQ309tXVc" variant="text"><>the block leader</></Button>, and get in touch with the team via our <Button href="https://discord.com/invite/mrgn" variant="text"><>Discord</></Button>, so delegating your tokens to a reputable validator can enhance the security and efficiency of the network.

But what if you want to earn staking rewards without locking up your SOL, so you can still use your assets within the DeFi ecosystem? That’s where liquid staking comes in.

Liquid staking allows you to stake your SOL and receive a tokenized version of your staked SOL, called LST (Liquid Staking Token). This means **you can continue to earn staking rewards while maintaining the liquidity of your assets**. In September 2023, marginfi launched its liquid staking product, LST. Unlike traditional staking methods, **LST does not charge users any commission fees or protocol fees from income validators**, meaning users receive the full amount of staking rewards.
