# marginfi Liquid Incentive Program Documentation

The Liquidity Incentive Program is a <Button href="https://github.com/mrgnlabs/marginfi-v2/tree/main/programs/liquidity-incentive-program" variant="text"><>fully open-sourced proxy program</></Button> for marginfi-v2. It allows anyone to create campaigns and incentivize other users to deposit into and lock their funds in marginfi-v2 by offering guaranteed yields. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The official LIP program address on Solana mainnet-beta is <Button href="https://solscan.io/account/LipsxuAkFkwa4RKNzn51wAsW7Dedzt1RNHMkTkDEZUW" variant="text"><>LipsxuAkFkwa4RKNzn51wAsW7Dedzt1RNHMkTkDEZUW</></Button>. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Features {{ tag: '', label: '' }}

### Permissionless campaign creation

Anyone can create a new incentive campaign without needing special permissions or approvals. This allows for a decentralized and open system where anyone can contribute to boosting liquidity in the protocol.

### Arbitrary asset support

The program supports incentivizing deposits for any asset listed on the marginfi-v2 protocol. This flexibility enables campaigns to target specific assets or a range of assets based on the organizer's goals.

### Configurable lock-up periods

When creating a campaign, the organizer can specify the duration for which deposited assets must remain locked in the protocol to qualify for the incentives. This allows tailoring campaigns to suit different liquidity needs and user preferences.

## How It Works {{ tag: '', label: '' }}

`liquidity-incentive-program` primarily works off of the `Campaign` concept.

Think of a `Campaign` as a marketing campaign:

1. Each campaign has a creator, who becomes the `admin` of that campaign.
2. The creator selects:
    - the type of asset to incentivize deposits for (e.g. $SOL)
    - the lockup period that depositors' funds will be locked up for
    - the maximum amount of user deposits allowed
    - The maximum rewards to be paid out to users (together with the maximum amount of deposits allowed, this calculates the guaranteed fixed yield).

<Note>
LIP works off of the concept of a minimum guaranteed yield, but depositors may earn higher yield if marginfi's native lender yield for the related asset exceeds the yield guaranteed by the Campaign. This is a win-win for depositors.
</Note>

1. As a proof of reward reserves, campaign creators **lock up maximum rewards to be paid out upon campaign creation**, making it easy for campaign depositors to know the source of yield.
2. In product UIs, each `Campaign` typically highlights a fixed `APY`, but there is no compounding involved in the guaranteed yield. Since `APY` accounts for compounding effects even if there are none, measuring yield in `APY` gives depositors the correct impression that they should expect the yield they see. In the smart contract, yield is specified via the `max_rewards` parameter of each `Campaign`.
3. When users deposit funds into an LIP `Campaign`, funds are stored directly in `marginfi`. Funds earn `marginfi` lender yield. When lockups expire, depositors are paid `max(guarenteed yield, earned lender yield)` for the assets they deposited. As earned lender yield grows above `0%`, it subsidizes the expense that campaign creators pay out of the rewards they've escrowed. **This is a win-win for campaign creators**.
