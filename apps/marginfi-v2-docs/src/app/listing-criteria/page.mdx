# Listing Criteria

On this page, we will explain the criteria for listing a token on the marginfi protocol. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Market Capitalization {{ tag: '', label: '' }}

We typically look for tokens with a **fully diluted market capitalization (FDV) of at least $20 million**. A substantial market cap can be an indicator of a project's traction, adoption, and potential for long-term sustainability.

## Trading Volume {{ tag: '', label: '' }}

To ensure sufficient liquidity for our users, we prefer listing tokens with a **daily trading volume exceeding $1 million** across various decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools.

## Liquidity Providers {{ tag: '', label: '' }}

**We prioritize tokens that have multiple liquidity providers**, as this diversity in liquidity sources can contribute to better price stability and overall liquidity for borrowing and lending activities.

It's important to note that these criteria serve as rough guidelines, and our team reserves the right to make listing decisions based on a comprehensive evaluation process that may include additional factors beyond the thresholds mentioned above.
