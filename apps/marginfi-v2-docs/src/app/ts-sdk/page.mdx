# The marginfi TypeScript SDK

The <Button href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2" variant="text"><>marginfi-client-v2</></Button> and <Button href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common" variant="text"><>mrgn-common</></Button> NPM packages are the official TypeScript SDKs for interacting with the marginfi protocol. You can use these SDKs in your Node.js frontend and backend to perform tasks like creating banks, making deposits to existing banks, and more.  {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Installation {{ tag: '', label: '' }}

<Note>
    It is recommended you use at least Node version `20.10.0` and NPM version `10.2.3`.
</Note>

To get started, simply initialize your Node.js project and install the packages using your preferred package manager.

```bash {{ title: 'Using NPM' }}
npm install @mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2 @mrgnlabs/mrgn-common
```

```bash {{ title: 'Using Yarn' }}
yarn add @mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2 @mrgnlabs/mrgn-common
```

---

## Getting Started {{ tag: '', label: '' }}

### Step 1: Initialize the marginfi client 

<Note>
    This example uses @solana/web3.js version 1.91.8
</Note>

In order to interact with the marginfi SDK, we must first configure the marginfi client object using the `MarginfiClient` instance:

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { MarginfiClient, getConfig } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';
import { NodeWallet } from "@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common";

const connection = new Connection(CLUSTER_CONNECTION, "confirmed");
const wallet = NodeWallet.local();
const config = getConfig("dev");
const client = await MarginfiClient.fetch(config, wallet, connection);
```

- `connection` establishes a connection to a Solana cluster
- `wallet` creates an Anchor-compliant Node.js wallet from your <Button href="https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/wallets/" variant="text"><>local Solana keypair</></Button>
- `config` returns a configuration object specific to the specified environment (e.g. “production”, “development”)
- `client` is a high-level SDK for interacting with the Marginfi protocol

### Step 2: Create an Account

Accounts on marginfi are the entry point for interacting with the protocol, allowing users to deposit assets, take out loans, and manage their positions. Using the marginfi SDK, you can create an account with one line of code. With this ability, you can enable seamless user onboarding by creating dedicated accounts for each new user. 

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
const marginfiAccount = await client.createMarginfiAccount();
```

### Step 3: Fetch a Bank

In order to interact with asset pools, or “banks,” on marginfi, you must first fetch the specific bank you want to borrow/lend from:

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
const bankLabel = "SOL";
const bank = client.getBankByTokenSymbol(bankLabel);
if (!bank) throw Error(`${bankLabel} bank not found`);
```

- `bankLabel` holds the symbol for the bank that you will fetch. Note that you can also query banks by the token mint address (using `getBankByMint`) or by the bank address (using `getBankByPk`).
- `bank1` fetches the specified bank using `getBankByTokenSymbol`, using the bank’s token symbol “SOL” as the query parameter.

### Step 4: Make a Deposit

Once you’ve fetched the bank you want to interact with, you can make a deposit:

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
await marginfiAccount.deposit(1, bank.address);
```

The `deposit` method on the marginfi account object allows you to  make a deposit into the specified bank account using the bank's address as a parameter (second parameter). Note that the first parameter let’s you specify how much (in the denominated asset) you want to deposit into the bank.

### Step 5: Borrow From a Bank

After lending liquidity on marginfi, you’re account is eligible to act as a Borrower. You can borrow liquidity from marginfi banks using one line of code:

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
await marginfiAccount.borrow(1, bank.address);
```

The structure of the `borrow` method is identical to the `deposit` method. You specify the amount you want to borrow using the first parameter, and you specify which bank you want to interact with using the second parameter.

if you followed along with these steps, you just want through the full lending-and-borrowing lifecycle on marginfi. To execute your node, simply tun `ts-node <file-path>` in your terminal. You’re code should look like this:

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { MarginfiClient, getConfig } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';
import { NodeWallet } from "@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common";

const CLUSTER_CONNECTION = <your-rpc-url>;

const main = async () => {
	const connection = new Connection(CLUSTER_CONNECTION, "confirmed");
	const wallet = NodeWallet.local();
	const config = getConfig("dev");
	const client = await MarginfiClient.fetch(config, wallet, connection); // initialize client
	
	const marginfiAccount = await client.createMarginfiAccount(); // create an account
	
	const bankLabel = "SOL";
	const bank = client.getBankByTokenSymbol(bankLabel);
	if (!bank) throw Error(`${bankLabel} bank not found`); // fetch a bank
	
	await marginfiAccount.deposit(1, bank.address); // make a deposit
	await marginfiAccount.borrow(1, bank.address); // borrow from a bank
};

main();
```

You’re now a mrgn mama! For more details on the marginfi SDK and use cases, refer to the sections below.

## Classes {{ tag: '', label: '' }}

### `MarginfiClient`

The `MarginfiClient` instance is the entry point to interact with the marginfi protocol. You can setup your `MarginfiClient` like so:

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
const connection = new Connection(CLUSTER_CONNECTION, "confirmed");
const wallet = NodeWallet.local()
const config = getConfig("dev");
const client = await MarginfiClient.fetch(config, wallet, connection);
```

### Fetching All Banks Owned by the marginfi-v2 Program

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
import { Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { MarginfiClient, getConfig, AccountType, Bank } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';
import { NodeWallet } from "@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common";

    // Fetch all public keys of banks owned by the mfi program
    const bankPubKeys = await client.getAllProgramAccountAddresses(AccountType.Bank);

    const banks = await Promise.all(
        bankPubKeys.map(async (bankPubKey) => {
            try {
                // Fetch account data for each bank
                const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(bankPubKey);
                if (accountInfo === null) {
                    console.error(`Failed to fetch account info for ${bankPubKey.toString()}`);
                    return null;
                }

        console.log(`Bank ${index + 1}:`, bank);
    });
}

main().catch((e) => console.log(e));
```

### Fetching and Exporting Depositors for a Specific Bank

Using the marginfi SDK, fetch all Marginfi accounts that have an active deposit in a specific bank token (e.g., SOL). Then export the wallet address, user account address, and deposit amount for those accounts into a CSV file.

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
import { PublicKey, Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { MarginfiAccountWrapper, MarginfiClient, getConfig } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';
import { NodeWallet, chunkedGetRawMultipleAccountInfos, chunks } from "@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common";
import fs from "fs";

const BANK_TOKEN = "SOL";

interface BankDepositor {
  wallet: string;
  userAccount: string;
  amount: number;
}

async function main() {
  const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com", "confirmed");
  const wallet = NodeWallet.local()
  const config = getConfig("dev");
  const client = await MarginfiClient.fetch(config, wallet, connection);

  const targetBank = client.getBankByTokenSymbol(BANK_TOKEN);
  if (!targetBank) {
    throw new Error(`Bank ${BANK_TOKEN} not found`);
  }

  console.log(`Fetching all marginfi accounts...`)
  const marginfiAccountAddresses = await client.getAllMarginfiAccountAddresses();
  console.log(`Found ${marginfiAccountAddresses.length} marginfi accounts`);

  const addressBatches = chunks(marginfiAccountAddresses, 25_000); // To avoid blowing memory

  const depositorFileName = `./marginfi_depositors_${BANK_TOKEN}_${Date.now()}.csv`;
  fs.writeFileSync(depositorFileName, "wallet,user_account,amount\n");

  for (let i = 0; i < addressBatches.length; i++) {
    const addressBatch = addressBatches[i];
    console.log(`Processing batch ${i + 1}/${addressBatches.length} of ${addressBatch.length} addresses`);

    const [_, accountInfoMap] = await chunkedGetRawMultipleAccountInfos(
      client.provider.connection,
      addressBatch.map((pk) => pk.toBase58())
    );

    let depositors: BankDepositor[] = [];
    for (const [address, accountInfo] of accountInfoMap) {
      const marginfiAccount = MarginfiAccountWrapper.fromAccountDataRaw(new PublicKey(address), client, accountInfo.data);
      const depositAmount = marginfiAccount.balances
        .find((b) => b.active && b.bankPk.equals(targetBank.address) && b.assetShares.gt(0))
        ?.computeQuantityUi(targetBank).assets;
      if (depositAmount) {
        depositors.push({
          wallet: marginfiAccount.authority.toString(),
          userAccount: marginfiAccount.address.toString(),
          amount: depositAmount.toNumber(),
        });
      }
    }
    const csvContent = depositors.map(depositor => `${depositor.wallet},${depositor.userAccount},${depositor.amount}`).join('\n');
    fs.appendFileSync(depositorFileName, csvContent);
  }
}

main().catch((e) => console.log(e));
```

### Account Creation and Deposit

<Note>
    The following program costs (developer-network) SOL to execute.
</Note>

Use the marginfi SDK to create a new account and deposit tokens from two different banks (SOL and USDC) into the account. Then retrieve the active balances for the account, calculate the USD value of the assets and liabilities for each balance, and log this information to the console.

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { MarginfiClient } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';
import { NodeWallet } from "@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common";

async function main() {
	const connection = new Connection("<rpc-url>", "confirmed");
  const wallet = NodeWallet.local()
  const config = getConfig("<environment>");
  const client = await MarginfiClient.fetch(config, wallet, connection);

  console.log(`Using ${client.config.environment} environment; wallet: ${client.wallet.publicKey.toBase58()}`);

  const marginfiAccount = await client.createMarginfiAccount();

  const bankLabel1 = "SOL";
  const bank1 = client.getBankByTokenSymbol(bankLabel1);
  if (!bank1) throw Error(`${bankLabel1} bank not found`);
  const bankLabel2 = "USDC";
  const bank2 = client.getBankByTokenSymbol(bankLabel2);
  if (!bank2) throw Error(`${bankLabel2} bank not found`);

  await marginfiAccount.deposit(1, bank1.address);
  await marginfiAccount.deposit(2, bank2.address);

  await marginfiAccount.reload();

  marginfiAccount.activeBalances.forEach((balance) => {
    const bank = client.getBankByPk(balance.bankPk)!;
    const oraclePrice = client.getOraclePriceByBank(bank.address)!;
    const { assets, liabilities } = balance.computeUsdValue(bank, oraclePrice, MarginRequirementType.Equity);

    console.log(
      `Balance for ${shortenAddress(bank.mint)} (${shortenAddress(
        balance.bankPk
      )}) deposits: ${assets}, borrows: ${liabilities}`
    );
  });
}

main().catch((e) => console.log(e));

```

### Display a Accounts

Fetch a marginfi account and display it’s data.

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { MarginfiClient, MarginfiAccountWrapper } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';
import { NodeWallet } from "@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common";

const MFI_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS = "<account-address>"; // e.g., 3oS3RJ8UYrYw7TAQEVh6u6ifrHi35o3DnvqyqGti4Gwa

async function main() {
	const connection = new Connection("<rpc-url>", "confirmed");
	const wallet = NodeWallet.local()
	const config = getConfig("<environment>");
	const client = await MarginfiClient.fetch(config, wallet, connection);

  const marginfiAccount = await MarginfiAccountWrapper.fetch(MFI_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS, client);

  console.log("Account state:");
  console.log(marginfiAccount.describe());
}

main().catch((e) => console.log(e));
```


### Conduct a Flash Loan

Fetch a marginfi account, get a bank via token symbol, and perform a flashloan using the bank.

```javascript {{ title: 'Example' }}
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { MarginfiClient, MarginfiAccountWrapper } from '@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2';
import { NodeWallet } from "@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common";

async function main() {
  const connection = new Connection("<rpc-url>", "confirmed");
	const wallet = NodeWallet.local()
	const config = getConfig("<environment>");
	const client = await MarginfiClient.fetch(config, wallet, connection);

  const marginfiAccounts = await client.getMarginfiAccountsForAuthority();
  if (marginfiAccounts.length === 0) throw Error("No marginfi account found");

  const marginfiAccount = marginfiAccounts[0];

  const solBank = client.getBankByTokenSymbol("SOL");
  if (!solBank) throw Error("SOL bank not found");

  const amount = 10; // SOL

  const borrowIx = await marginfiAccount.makeBorrowIx(amount, solBank.address);
  const repayIx = await marginfiAccount.makeRepayIx(amount, solBank.address, true);

  const flashLoanTx = await marginfiAccount.buildFlashLoanTx({
    ixs: [...borrowIx.instructions, ...repayIx.instructions],
    signers: [],
  });

  await client.processTransaction(flashLoanTx);
}

main().catch((e) => console.log(e));
```
