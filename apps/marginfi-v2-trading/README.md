The marginfi V2 UI is a nextjs web client that serves as the frontend for the mrgnlend lending platform. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your lending and borrowing activities on the Solana blockchain. The UI is built using Next.js, a popular React-based framework for building server-rendered or statically exported React applications.

Leverages a number of other `@mrgnlabs` TypeScript packages, all available in the same [monorepo](https://github.com/mrgnlabs/mrgn-ts).
