      "summary": "The `CampaignWizard` component is a React functional component that allows users to create a new LIP (Lending and Borrowing Protocol) campaign. The component imports various modules from different packages, including `@solana/web3.js`, `@project-serum/anchor`, `@mrgnlabs/mrgn-common`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`, and `@mui/material`. \n\nThe component renders a form with several input fields, including a dropdown menu to select the campaign asset, an input field to set the guaranteed APY (annual percentage yield), an input field to set the lockup period in days, and an input field to set the campaign size in asset units. The component also displays a summary of the user's input and the calculated campaign APY. Finally, the component includes a button to create the campaign.\n\nThe `CampaignWizard` component uses several hooks, including `useState`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect`. The `useState` hook is used to manage the component's state, including the guaranteed APY, lockup period, deposit capacity, and campaign bank. The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the available banks and the contract inputs. The `useCallback` hook is used to create the `onChange` function for the input fields. The `useEffect` hook is used to set the default campaign bank when the available banks change.\n\nThe `CampaignWizardInputBox` component is a child component of `CampaignWizard` that renders a numeric input field with a custom format. The component uses the `NumericFormat` component from the `react-number-format` package to format the input field. The component also includes a `loadingSafetyCheck` function that is called when the user inputs a value greater than the maximum value allowed.\n\nOverall, the `CampaignWizard` component is an important part of the LIP protocol that allows users to create new campaigns with different parameters. The component is designed to be user-friendly and includes several input fields with custom formats to ensure that users input valid values.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CampaignWizard` component?\n- The `CampaignWizard` component is used to create an LIP campaign, and it allows the user to input various parameters such as the campaign asset, guaranteed APY, lockup period, and campaign size.\n\n2. What external libraries and APIs are being used in this file?\n- The file is importing various libraries and APIs such as React, @solana/web3.js, @project-serum/anchor, @mrgnlabs/mrgn-common, @solana/wallet-adapter-react, and next/image.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CampaignWizardInputBox` component?\n- The `CampaignWizardInputBox` component is a reusable input box that is used in the `CampaignWizard` component to allow the user to input numerical values. It includes functionality to cap the input value at a maximum value if specified, and to format the input value with commas and decimal places."

      "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `MultipleAccountsFoundWarning`. This component is used to display a warning message when multiple user accounts are found, which is not supported by the application. The warning message is displayed in a div element with a specific class name that defines its styling. The class name includes properties such as background color, border radius, padding, and font size. The message itself is a string that informs the user that multiple accounts were found and advises them to contact the team or use the application at their own risk.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to provide a warning message to users when multiple accounts are detected. This can help prevent errors or confusion that may arise from having multiple accounts associated with a single user. The component can be imported into other React components and used as a child element to display the warning message.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { MultipleAccountsFoundWarning } from \"mrgn-ts\";\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const accounts = [\"account1\", \"account2\", \"account3\"];\n\n  if (accounts.length > 1) {\n    return <MultipleAccountsFoundWarning />;\n  }\n\n  return <div>My component content</div>;\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` checks if there are multiple accounts associated with the user. If there are, it returns the `MultipleAccountsFoundWarning` component to display the warning message. If not, it displays the content of the component as usual. This helps ensure that users are aware of the potential risks of using multiple accounts and can take appropriate action to avoid any issues.",

This class name applies CSS styles to the `div` element, including making it a flex container that is horizontally centered and has a solid border at the top and bottom of 1 pixel width. The \"hidden sm:flex\" part of the class name means that the element is hidden on small screens but displayed as a flex container on larger screens.\n\nInside the `div` element, there is another `div` element that contains the actual header content. This `div` element has a class name that applies CSS styles to it, including setting its height to 80 pixels, its width to 90% of its parent element's width, and its maximum width to 7xl (a custom size). It also sets the left padding to 60 pixels, aligns its child elements vertically centered, and applies a custom font and font size. The background of the `div` element is set to an image file called \"WaveBG3.png\" using a URL.\n\nThe text \"mrgnlend\" is displayed inside the inner `div` element as the header content.\n\nThis component can be used in other parts of the project by importing it and rendering it as a JSX element.

          "summary": "The code defines two React functional components, `AccountBalance` and `MobileHealth`, which are used to display account balance and health factor information respectively. Both components take in two props: `isConnected`, a boolean value indicating whether the user is connected to the application, and `accountBalance` or `healthFactor`, which are numbers representing the user's account balance and health factor respectively.\n\nThe `AccountBalance` component renders a div with a fixed width and height, displaying the account balance information. The `usdFormatter` function from the `~/utils/formatters` module is used to format the account balance as a USD currency string. If the user is not connected, the component displays a dash instead of the account balance.\n\nThe `MobileHealth` component also renders a div with a fixed width and height, displaying the health factor information. The health factor is represented as a percentage and displayed in a text element. The color of the text changes based on the health factor value, with a gradient from red to green. If the user is not connected, the component displays a dash instead of the health factor.\n\nThese components can be used in a larger React application to display account balance and health factor information to the user. The `isConnected` prop can be passed down from a parent component to determine whether the user is currently connected to the application. The `accountBalance` and `healthFactor` props can be obtained from a state management system or API call and passed down to these components for rendering.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { AccountBalance, MobileHealth } from \"mrgn-ts\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);\n  const [accountBalance, setAccountBalance] = useState(0);\n  const [healthFactor, setHealthFactor] = useState(0.5);\n\n  // code to update isConnected, accountBalance, and healthFactor state\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <AccountBalance isConnected={isConnected} accountBalance={accountBalance} />\n      <MobileHealth isConnected={isConnected} healthFactor={healthFactor} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```",

What is the purpose of the `usdFormatter` function imported from \"~/utils/formatters\"?\n- The `usdFormatter` function is used to format the `accountBalance` value as a USD currency string in the `AccountBalance` component.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `healthFactor` prop in the `MobileHealth` component?\n- The `healthFactor` prop is used to calculate the color of the percentage value displayed in the component, with higher values resulting in more green and lower values resulting in more red.\n\n3. Why are the `AccountBalance` and `MobileHealth` components structured similarly?\n- The components are structured similarly because they share a common layout and styling, with different text and value formatting based on their respective props. This allows for code reuse and easier maintenance."

It then calculates the health factor of the selected account, which is a measure of the account's solvency. The health factor is calculated by dividing the difference between the assets and liabilities of the account by the assets, and then converting the result to a number. If the selected account is null, the health factor is set to 1.\n\nThe component then renders the account summary information in a responsive layout. On mobile devices, the account balance and health factor are displayed side-by-side, while on desktop devices only the account balance is displayed. The component also displays three account metrics: lending amount, borrowing amount, and net APY. The lending and borrowing amounts are displayed as formatted USD amounts, while the net APY is displayed as a percentage with a color-coded preview of whether it is positive or negative. Finally, the component displays the health factor as a circular gauge.\n\nThis component is likely used as part of a larger project that provides a user interface for a financial application.

          "summary": "The code defines a custom toggle switch component called `BorrowLendToggle` that is used to switch between two modes: borrowing and lending. The component is built using the `styled` function from the Material UI library and extends the `Switch` component from the same library. \n\nThe `BorrowLendToggle` component takes in two props: `isInLendingMode` and `setIsInLendingMode`. The former is a boolean value that indicates whether the toggle is currently in lending mode or not, while the latter is a function that updates the `isInLendingMode` prop when the toggle is clicked. \n\nThe component renders a `Switch` component with some custom styles applied to it. The `checked` prop of the `Switch` component is set to the opposite of the `isInLendingMode` prop, which means that the toggle will be in the opposite mode of the current `isInLendingMode` value. When the toggle is clicked, the `setIsInLendingMode` function is called with the opposite value of the current `isInLendingMode` value, effectively toggling the mode.\n\nThe custom styles applied to the `Switch` component include setting the width and height of the component, setting the background color and border, and adding text labels for the two modes. The `& .MuiSwitch-switchBase` selector is used to style the thumb of the toggle, while the `& .MuiSwitch-thumb` selector is used to style the track of the toggle.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that requires a toggle switch to switch between two modes, such as a borrowing and lending mode in a financial application. An example usage of the component would be as follows:\n\n```\nimport { BorrowLendToggle } from 'mrgn-ts';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isInLendingMode, setIsInLendingMode] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <BorrowLendToggle isInLendingMode={isInLendingMode} setIsInLendingMode={setIsInLendingMode} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
          "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BorrowLendToggle` component?\n   - The `BorrowLendToggle` component is a styled switch component that toggles between \"Borrow\" and \"Lend\" modes and updates the `isInLendingMode` state based on the user's selection.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `BorrowLendToggleProps` interface?\n   - The `BorrowLendToggleProps` interface extends the `SwitchProps` interface from the `@mui/material` library and adds two additional properties: `isInLendingMode` and `setIsInLendingMode`, which are used to manage the state of the toggle.\n\n3. Why is there a `focusVisibleClassName` property in the `Switch` component?\n   - The `focusVisibleClassName` property is used to apply a class name to the switch component when it is focused, which can be used to apply custom styles to the focused state of the component."

When the user clicks the action button, the component performs various checks to ensure that the user has entered a valid amount and that the user has the necessary funds to perform the action. If the checks pass, the component creates a Marginfi account for the user (if one does not already exist) and performs the relevant Solana transaction (e.g., deposit, withdraw, borrow, or repay).

          "summary": "The `AirdropZone` component is responsible for rendering a modal that allows users to request airdrops of various tokens. The component imports several dependencies, including `Button` and `Modal` from the Material UI library, `FC` and `useCallback` from React, and several functions from Solana and mrgn-common libraries.\n\nThe component defines several constants that represent the amount of tokens to be airdropped, the mint addresses of the tokens, and the faucet addresses of the tokens. These constants are used in the `airdropToken` function, which is responsible for creating and sending a transaction to the Solana network to request an airdrop of a specific token. The function takes three arguments: `amount`, `mint`, and `faucet`. If the user has a sufficient balance of SOL, the function creates an associated token account (ATA) for the specified mint if one does not already exist, and then sends a transaction to the faucet to request an airdrop of the specified amount of tokens to the ATA.\n\nThe `AirdropZone` component renders a button that, when clicked, opens a modal that displays three additional buttons, each of which corresponds to a different token. When a button is clicked, the corresponding `airdropToken` function is called with the appropriate arguments. The component also uses the `toast` function from the `react-toastify` library to display a loading spinner and a success or error message when an airdrop is requested.\n\nOverall, the `AirdropZone` component provides a simple interface for users to request airdrops of various tokens, and it leverages several Solana and mrgn-common libraries to handle the creation and sending of transactions. This component could be used in a larger project that requires users to interact with the Solana network and request airdrops of tokens.",

The component takes in three props: `activeBankInfo`, `marginfiAccount`, and `reloadPositions`. \n\n`activeBankInfo` is an object that contains information about the bank, token, and position. `marginfiAccount` is an instance of the `MarginfiAccount` class from the `@mrgnlabs/marginfi-client-v2` package, which is used to interact with the Marginfi API. `reloadPositions` is a function that is called to refresh the user's positions after a withdrawal or repayment.\n\nThe component renders three cells in the table row. The first cell contains the token icon and name. The second cell contains the amount of the token that the user is lending or borrowing, as well as an input box for the user to enter the amount they want to withdraw or repay. The third cell contains a button that triggers the withdrawal or repayment.\n\nWhen the user clicks the withdrawal or repayment button, the `withdrawOrRepay` function is called. This function first checks if the `marginfiAccount` object is ready and if the withdrawal or repayment amount is greater than zero. If either of these conditions is not met, an error message is displayed using the `toast` function from the `react-toastify` package.\n\nIf the conditions are met, the function calls the `withdraw` or `repay` method on the `marginfiAccount` object, depending on whether the user is lending or borrowing. The function then updates the `toast` message to indicate that the withdrawal or repayment was successful.\n\nAfter the withdrawal or repayment is complete, the `reloadPositions` function is called to refresh the user's positions. If there is an error while reloading the positions, an error message is displayed using the `toast` function.\n\nOverall, the `UserPositionRow` component provides a user interface for withdrawing or repaying tokens in a lending or borrowing market.

The `FC` interface is used to define the component as a function component that returns a JSX element.\n\nThe component returns a `Button` element with the `className` prop set to a string that concatenates the `font-aeonik` class with either the `bg-gray` or `bg-btn-light` class depending on whether the `disabled` prop is true or false. The `text-black`, `normal-case`, `text-sm`, `sm:mx-0`, `w-28`, `sm:w-30`, `h-10`, and `max-w-1` classes are also concatenated to the `className` prop. These classes are used for styling purposes and can be customized as needed.\n\nThe `...otherProps` syntax is used to spread any additional props passed to the component onto the `Button` element.

The `value` prop is the current value of the input box, `setValue` is a function that updates the value, `maxValue` is the maximum value allowed for the input box, and `maxDecimals` is the maximum number of decimal places allowed for the input box.\n\nThe component uses the `NumericFormat` component from the `react-number-format` library to format the input value. The `NumericFormat` component takes in several props, including `value`, `placeholder`, `allowNegative`, `decimalScale`, `onValueChange`, `thousandSeparator`, `customInput`, `size`, `max`, and `InputProps`. The `value` prop is the current value of the input box, `placeholder` is the text to display when the input box is empty, `allowNegative` specifies whether negative values are allowed, `decimalScale` is the number of decimal places to display, `onValueChange` is a function that is called when the value changes, `thousandSeparator` is the character used to separate thousands, `customInput` is the component to use for the input box, `size` is the size of the input box, `max` is the maximum value allowed for the input box, and `InputProps` is an object that contains additional props to pass to the input box.\n\nThe `UserPositionRowInputBox` component also defines an `onClick` function that is called when the \"max\" button is clicked. If the `maxValue` prop is defined, the `onClick` function sets the value of the input box to the `maxValue` prop.\n\nThe component also defines an `onChange` function that is called when the value of the input box changes. The `onChange` function first checks if the new value is valid (i.e., it only contains digits and at most one decimal point). If the new value is not valid, the function returns without updating the value. Otherwise, the function converts the new value to a number and checks if it exceeds the `maxValue` prop (if defined). If the new value exceeds the `maxValue` prop, the function sets the value of the input box to the `maxValue` prop. Otherwise, the function updates the value of the input box to the new value.\n\nFinally, the component renders the `NumericFormat` component with the appropriate props and some additional styling. The component also renders a `MaxInputAdornment` component that displays a \"max\" button next to the input box. The `MaxInputAdornment` component takes in an `onClick` prop that is called when the \"max\" button is clicked.
