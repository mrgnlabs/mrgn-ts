  "summary": "The code defines two React functional components, `AccountBalance` and `MobileHealth`, which are used to display account balance and health factor information respectively. Both components take in two props: `isConnected`, a boolean value indicating whether the user is connected to the application, and `accountBalance` or `healthFactor`, which are numbers representing the user's account balance and health factor respectively.\n\nThe `AccountBalance` component renders a div with a fixed width and height, displaying the account balance information. The `usdFormatter` function from the `~/utils/formatters` module is used to format the account balance as a USD currency string. If the user is not connected, the component displays a dash instead of the account balance.\n\nThe `MobileHealth` component also renders a div with a fixed width and height, displaying the health factor information. The health factor is represented as a percentage and displayed in a text element. The color of the text changes based on the health factor value, with a gradient from red to green. If the user is not connected, the component displays a dash instead of the health factor.\n\nThese components can be used in a larger React application to display account balance and health factor information to the user. The `isConnected` prop can be passed down from a parent component to determine whether the user is currently connected to the application. The `accountBalance` and `healthFactor` props can be obtained from a state management system or API call and passed down to these components for rendering.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { AccountBalance, MobileHealth } from \"mrgn-ts\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);\n  const [accountBalance, setAccountBalance] = useState(0);\n  const [healthFactor, setHealthFactor] = useState(0.5);\n\n  // code to update isConnected, accountBalance, and healthFactor state\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <AccountBalance isConnected={isConnected} accountBalance={accountBalance} />\n      <MobileHealth isConnected={isConnected} healthFactor={healthFactor} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `usdFormatter` function imported from \"~/utils/formatters\"?\n- The `usdFormatter` function is used to format the `accountBalance` value as a USD currency string in the `AccountBalance` component.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `healthFactor` prop in the `MobileHealth` component?\n- The `healthFactor` prop is used to calculate the color of the percentage value displayed in the component, with higher values resulting in more green and lower values resulting in more red.\n\n3. Why are the `AccountBalance` and `MobileHealth` components structured similarly?\n- The components are structured similarly because they share a common layout and styling, with different text and value formatting based on their respective props. This allows for code reuse and easier maintenance."
