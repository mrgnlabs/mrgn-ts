  "summary": "This code is a license for a font called \"Plex\" that is being used in the mrgn-ts project. The license is the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1, which allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified, and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed, and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\n\nThis license is important for the mrgn-ts project because it ensures that the font being used is licensed appropriately and can be used freely without any legal issues. It also allows for modifications to be made to the font if necessary, which can be useful for customizing the font to fit the needs of the project.\n\nExample usage of this license in the mrgn-ts project would be to include the license file in the project's repository and ensure that any derivative works of the font are not released under any other type of license. This ensures that the project is in compliance with the license and can continue to use the font without any legal issues.",
