  "summary": "This code is a module that exports a `connection` object used to connect to a Solana blockchain node. It uses the `@solana/web3.js` library to create a `Connection` object and sets the `commitment` level to \"confirmed\". It also uses the `fetch-retry` library to create a `fetchWithRetry` function that retries failed HTTP requests up to 3 times with a delay of 100ms between retries. Finally, it exports a `connection` object that is created by calling the `createConnection` function.\n\nThe `connection` object can be used to interact with the Solana blockchain node, such as querying account balances, sending transactions, and subscribing to events. The `commitment` level determines how many confirmations a transaction needs before it is considered final. Setting it to \"confirmed\" means that the transaction must be included in a confirmed block.\n\nThe `fetchWithRetry` function is used to make HTTP requests to the Solana node. It retries failed requests up to 3 times to handle temporary network errors. This is important because Solana transactions are time-sensitive and need to be processed quickly.\n\nThe `createConnection` function creates a new `Connection` object with the specified `RPC_ENDPOINT` and `commitment` level. It also sets the `fetch` option to use the `fetchWithRetry` function. This ensures that all HTTP requests made by the `Connection` object are retried if they fail.\n\nHere is an example of how this module can be used:\n\n```typescript\nimport { connection } from \"mrgn-ts\";\n\nasync function getBalance(publicKey: PublicKey): Promise<number> {\n  const balance = await connection.getBalance(publicKey, commitment);\n  return balance;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `getBalance` function uses the `connection` object to query the balance of a Solana account identified by `publicKey`. The `commitment` level is passed as an argument to ensure that the balance is final and confirmed. The function returns the account balance as a number.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Commitment` and `Connection` imports from `@solana/web3.js`?\n- The `Commitment` and `Connection` imports are likely used for interacting with the Solana blockchain network.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `fetchRetry` and `fetch` imports?\n- The `fetchRetry` and `fetch` imports are likely used for making HTTP requests, with `fetchRetry` providing retry functionality.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `env_config` import from \"../config\"?\n- The `env_config` import is likely used for accessing environment variables or configuration settings specific to the project."
