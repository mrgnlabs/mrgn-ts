  "summary": "The code provided is a TypeScript module that exports two functions: `deserializeAccountInfo` and `deserializeAccountInfosMap`. The module imports two libraries: `@solana/web3.js` and `@mongodb-js/zstd`.\n\nThe `deserializeAccountInfo` function takes an `AccountInfo` object as an argument and returns a new `AccountInfo` object with the `data` property mutated. The `data` property of the input `AccountInfo` object is a string array that is compressed using the Zstandard compression algorithm. The function first decompresses the `data` property using the `decompress` function from the `@mongodb-js/zstd` library. The decompressed data is then converted to a `Buffer` object using the `Buffer.from` method. Finally, a new `AccountInfo` object is returned with the `data` property set to the decompressed `Buffer` object.\n\nThe `deserializeAccountInfosMap` function takes a `Map` object as an argument, where the keys are strings and the values are `AccountInfo` objects with string arrays as their `data` property. The function returns a new `Map` object with the same keys as the input `Map` object, but with the `AccountInfo` objects' `data` property mutated to `Buffer` objects using the `deserializeAccountInfo` function. The function first creates an empty `Map` object called `deserializedAccountInfoMap`. It then iterates over the input `Map` object using the `forEach` method and pushes a `Promise` object to the `promises` array for each `AccountInfo` object in the input `Map`. Each `Promise` object is created by calling the `deserializeAccountInfo` function with the corresponding `AccountInfo` object as an argument. The `Promise` object resolves with the mutated `AccountInfo` object, which is then added to the `deserializedAccountInfoMap` using the `set` method. The `Promise` object is also resolved with `void 0` to ensure that the `Promise` object resolves with `undefined`. Finally, the `Promise.all` method is called with the `promises` array as an argument to wait for all `Promise` objects to resolve. The `deserializedAccountInfoMap` is then returned.\n\nThis module can be used in a larger project that involves working with Solana blockchain accounts. The `deserializeAccountInfo` function can be used to decompress and convert the `data` property of an `AccountInfo` object to a `Buffer` object. The `deserializeAccountInfosMap` function can be used to apply the `deserializeAccountInfo` function to a `Map` object of `AccountInfo` objects. This can be useful when working with large amounts of compressed data in Solana accounts.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `deserializeAccountInfo` function?\n- The `deserializeAccountInfo` function takes an `AccountInfo` object with a string array data property, decompresses the data using Zstandard compression, and returns a new `AccountInfo` object with a Buffer data property.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `deserializeAccountInfosMap` function?\n- The `deserializeAccountInfosMap` function takes a `Map` of `AccountInfo` objects with string array data properties, deserializes each `AccountInfo` object using the `deserializeAccountInfo` function, and returns a new `Map` of `AccountInfo` objects with Buffer data properties.\n\n3. Why is the `data` property of the `AccountInfo` object mutated in the `deserializeAccountInfo` function?\n- The `data` property of the `AccountInfo` object is purposely mutated to a Buffer object because it is faster to work with than a string array."
