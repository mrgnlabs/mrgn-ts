      "summary": "This code defines an array of objects that represent different tokens on the Solana blockchain. Each object contains information about a specific token, such as its address, chain ID, decimals, name, symbol, logo URI, and coingecko ID. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for storing information about different tokens that are used within the mrgn-ts project. This information can be used by other parts of the project to interact with these tokens, such as querying their balances or transferring them between accounts. \n\nFor example, if a user wants to transfer some Wrapped SOL tokens to another account, they would need to know the token's address and decimals. This information can be obtained from the object in the array that corresponds to Wrapped SOL. \n\n```\nconst wrappedSol = tokens.find(token => token.symbol === 'SOL');\nconst transferAmount = 1000000000; // 1 Wrapped SOL\nconst recipientAddress = 'So22222222222222222222222222222222222222222';\n\n// Transfer Wrapped SOL to recipient\nawait connection.sendTransaction(\n  new Transaction().add(\n    SystemProgram.transfer({\n      fromPubkey: wallet.publicKey,\n      toPubkey: new PublicKey(recipientAddress),\n      lamports: transferAmount,\n    })\n  ),\n  [wallet],\n  { skipPreflight: false, preflightCommitment: 'singleGossip' }\n);\n```\n\nOverall, this code serves as a useful reference for developers working on the mrgn-ts project who need to interact with different tokens on the Solana blockchain.

This license ensures that the font can be used, modified, and distributed freely without any legal issues.\n\nThe IBM_Plex_Mono font is a monospaced font that is part of the IBM Plex font family. It is designed to be used in programming environments and is optimized for legibility and ease of use. The font is available in several weights and styles, including regular, bold, italic, and bold italic.\n\nIn the context of the mrgn-ts project, the IBM_Plex_Mono font may be used in various parts of the project where a monospaced font is required. For example, it may be used in the code editor or terminal interface of the project. The font may also be used in the project's documentation or website to provide a consistent and professional look and feel.\n\nHere is an example of how the IBM_Plex_Mono font may be used in the mrgn-ts project:\n\n```css\nbody {\n  font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the IBM_Plex_Mono font is set as the font family for the body element of the project's website. The monospace fallback ensures that the font is displayed correctly on all devices and browsers. The font size and line height are also set to provide a comfortable reading experience.\n\nOverall, the IBM_Plex_Mono font is an important part of the mrgn-ts project's design and functionality. Its legibility and ease of use make it an ideal choice for programming environments, and its availability under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1 ensures that it can be used freely without any legal issues.",
