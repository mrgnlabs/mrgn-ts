  "summary": "The `LipAccount` class is a wrapper around a specific LIP (Lending Incentive Program) account. It provides methods to fetch and store the latest on-chain state of the account, as well as decode marginfi account data according to the Anchor IDL. \n\nThe class takes in a `LipClient` instance, a `MarginfiClient` instance, an owner public key, an array of campaigns, and an array of deposits. The `fetch` method is a factory method that returns a new instance of `LipAccount` with the latest on-chain state of the account. The `reload` method updates the instance data by fetching and storing the latest on-chain state, while the `reloadAndClone` method does the same and returns a new instance of `LipAccount`.\n\nThe `getTotalBalance` method returns the total balance of the account by reducing the `usdValue` property of each deposit in the `deposits` array.\n\nThe `Deposit` class is a client type that represents a deposit in a LIP account. It takes in a `DepositData` object and a `Bank` object, and provides a `getUsdValue` method that returns the USD value of the deposit.\n\nThe `DepositData` interface represents the data of a deposit on-chain, while the `CampaignData` interface represents the data of a campaign on-chain. The `Campaign` interface extends the `CampaignData` interface and adds a `Bank` property.\n\nThe `AccountType` enum is used to specify the type of account when decoding marginfi account data according to the Anchor IDL.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to interact with LIP accounts and fetch their latest on-chain state. It can be used in the larger project to manage LIP accounts and perform operations on them, such as depositing and withdrawing funds.",
