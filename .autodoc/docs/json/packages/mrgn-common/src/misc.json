  "summary": "The code in this file provides helper functions for transaction processing and keypair loading in the mrgn-ts project. The `loadKeypair` function loads a keypair from a file path provided as an argument. If the path starts with `~`, it is replaced with the user's home directory path. The function then reads the file and returns a `Keypair` object created from the secret key stored in the file.\n\nThe `processTransaction` function is a helper function for processing transactions using the `@project-serum/anchor` library and the `@solana/web3.js` library. It takes a `provider` object, which is an instance of `AnchorProvider` that contains a connection to a Solana node and a wallet, a `tx` object, which is an instance of `Transaction` that represents the transaction to be processed, an optional array of `signers`, which are additional signers to be used in the transaction, and an optional `opts` object, which contains options for confirming the transaction. The function first creates a new `Connection` object using the `rpcEndpoint` and `opts` properties of the `provider` object. It then gets the latest blockhash and context from the Solana node using the `getLatestBlockhashAndContext` method of the `Connection` object. It sets the `recentBlockhash` property of the `tx` object to the blockhash obtained from the node, sets the `feePayer` property of the `tx` object to the public key of the wallet in the `provider` object, and signs the transaction using the wallet in the `provider` object. If additional signers are provided, the function partially signs the transaction using each signer. Finally, the function sends the signed transaction to the Solana node using the `sendRawTransaction` method of the `Connection` object and confirms the transaction using the `confirmTransaction` method of the `Connection` object. If an error occurs during the transaction processing, the function logs the error and throws it.\n\nThe `sleep` function is an internal helper function that takes a number of milliseconds as an argument and returns a promise that resolves after the specified number of milliseconds.\n\nThese functions can be used in the mrgn-ts project to load keypairs and process transactions on the Solana blockchain. For example, the `loadKeypair` function can be used to load a keypair from a file path and pass it to the `processTransaction` function as an additional signer. The `processTransaction` function can be used to send a transaction to the Solana blockchain and confirm it. The `sleep` function can be used internally in the project to delay execution for a specified amount of time.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `loadKeypair` function?\n- The `loadKeypair` function loads a keypair from a provided file and returns it as a `Keypair` object.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `processTransaction` function?\n- The `processTransaction` function is a helper function for processing transactions and handling errors. It takes in a provider, a transaction, an optional array of signers, and optional confirmation options, and returns a transaction signature.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `sleep` function?\n- The `sleep` function is an internal function that returns a promise that resolves after a specified number of milliseconds. It is likely used for delaying execution in certain parts of the code."
